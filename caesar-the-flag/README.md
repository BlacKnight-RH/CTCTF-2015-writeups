### Solution

As the title suggests, the problem description is the ciphertext of a [cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) where each letter is shifted by `n` positions. For example, if `n = 1`, then "A" would become "B," "B" would become "C," and so on. Because the letters loop around, there are only 25 possibilities in the solution space, making this cipher very easy to crack. Only one of them is likely to contain English.

Using [this tool](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/caesar.php), we got the flag when `n = 25`.

**Flag**: `step_it_up`
